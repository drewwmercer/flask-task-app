# flask-task-app

`python3 app.py`
- to activate virtual environment during dev:
`source env/bin/activate` 


## Implementation
- Developed & tested locally using Visual Studio Code (CLI GitHub and Heroku deployment)
- Hosted on a Free Dyno thanks to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)  
  - **Note:** This app is deployed on a free Heroku dyno. Free dynos will sleep after a half hour of inactivity (if they donâ€™t receive any traffic). This causes a delay of a few seconds for the first request upon waking. Subsequent requests will perform normally.
